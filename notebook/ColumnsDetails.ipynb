    "HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) are **communication protocols** used for transferring data over the web between a client (such as a web browser) and a server (such as a web server). They define the structure and format for requests and responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of web development and APIs, HTTP(S) defines several **request methods** or **verbs** that specify the type of action a client wants to perform on a resource. Here are the most common HTTP methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **GET**\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: To **retrieve** data from a server.\n",
    "   - **Example**: When you visit a website, your browser sends a `GET` request to fetch the webpage content.\n",
    "   - **Use Case**: Fetching a user profile, webpage, or list of products.\n",
    "   - **Example Request**:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     GET /users/123 HTTP/1.1\n",
    "     Host: example.com\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **POST**\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: To **send data** to the server, often to **create** a new resource.\n",
    "   - **Example**: When you submit a form (e.g., creating a new user, submitting a comment), a `POST` request is sent.\n",
    "   - **Use Case**: Creating a new user in a database, uploading a file, or posting a comment.\n",
    "   - **Example Request**:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     POST /users HTTP/1.1\n",
    "     Host: example.com\n",
    "     Content-Type: application/json\n",
    "\n",
    "     {\n",
    "       \"name\": \"John\",\n",
    "       \"email\": \"john@example.com\"\n",
    "     }\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **PUT**\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: To **update** an existing resource or create a resource if it doesn't exist.\n",
    "   - **Example**: Modifying user information like changing an email address.\n",
    "   - **Use Case**: Updating or replacing an existing entry in a database.\n",
    "   - **Example Request**:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     PUT /users/123 HTTP/1.1\n",
    "     Host: example.com\n",
    "     Content-Type: application/json\n",
    "\n",
    "     {\n",
    "       \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n",
    "       \"email\": \"john.doe@example.com\"\n",
    "     }\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **PATCH**\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: To **partially update** a resource.\n",
    "   - **Example**: Changing only the email address of a user without modifying the rest of their details.\n",
    "   - **Use Case**: Updating only a specific field in a record (e.g., just the email of a user).\n",
    "   - **Example Request**:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     PATCH /users/123 HTTP/1.1\n",
    "     Host: example.com\n",
    "     Content-Type: application/json\n",
    "\n",
    "     {\n",
    "       \"email\": \"new.email@example.com\"\n",
    "     }\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **DELETE**\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: To **delete** a resource on the server.\n",
    "   - **Example**: Removing a user's account from a website.\n",
    "   - **Use Case**: Deleting a file, record, or user profile.\n",
    "   - **Example Request**:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     DELETE /users/123 HTTP/1.1\n",
    "     Host: example.com\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **HEAD**\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Similar to `GET`, but it only retrieves the **headers** and not the response body.\n",
    "   - **Example**: Checking if a webpage exists and returning metadata like content length without downloading the whole page.\n",
    "   - **Use Case**: To check a file's metadata without downloading it.\n",
    "   - **Example Request**:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     HEAD /users/123 HTTP/1.1\n",
    "     Host: example.com\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **OPTIONS**\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: To request information about what **methods** and **features** are allowed on the server for a resource.\n",
    "   - **Example**: Checking which HTTP methods are supported for a certain URL.\n",
    "   - **Use Case**: Determining the allowed operations on a resource before performing an action.\n",
    "   - **Example Request**:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     OPTIONS /users/123 HTTP/1.1\n",
    "     Host: example.com\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **CONNECT**\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Used to **establish a tunnel** to the server, often used for HTTPS.\n",
    "   - **Example**: Browsers use `CONNECT` to connect to a server through a proxy, especially for SSL (HTTPS) requests.\n",
    "   - **Use Case**: Setting up a tunnel through proxies for SSL encrypted communication.\n",
    "   - **Example Request**:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     CONNECT example.com:443 HTTP/1.1\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. **TRACE**\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: To perform a message **loopback test** to see how the request is being modified or routed by intermediaries like proxies.\n",
    "   - **Use Case**: Debugging and testing purposes to see the full request path.\n",
    "   - **Example Request**:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     TRACE /users/123 HTTP/1.1\n",
    "     Host: example.com\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Difference between **HTTP** and **HTTPS**:\n",
    "- **HTTP**: Data is transmitted as plain text, making it vulnerable to interception.\n",
    "- **HTTPS**: Encrypts data using SSL/TLS, providing a secure communication channel.\n",
    "\n"
