# ineuron_internship-PhishingDomainDetection

##  Overview

This project focuses on developing a machine learning-based model to detect phishing domains, which are commonly used in cyberattacks to deceive users into providing sensitive information. The goal is to enhance cybersecurity by accurately identifying and mitigating the risks posed by malicious websites.

## Features

##### Data Collection:
Gathered a dataset of phishing and legitimate domains from various sources.

##### Data Preprocessing:
Cleaned and prepared the dataset, including feature extraction and encoding of domain attributes.

##### Model Development: 
Built and trained multiple machine learning models, such as Random Forest and GradientBoost, to classify domains as phishing or legitimate.

##### Model Evaluation: 
Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure high detection rates with minimal false positives.
