# **Problem Statement**
#### Phishing is a type of fraud in which an attacker impersonates a reputable company or person in order to get sensitive information such as login credentials or account information via email or other communication channels. Phishing is popular among attackers because it is easier to persuade someone to click a malicious link that appears to be authentic than it is to break through a computer's protection measures.

#### Objective
#### The mail goal is to predict whether the domains are real or malicious.

#### **Key Project Details:**

1. **URL Structure Analysis:**  
   Phishing URLs often contain abnormal patterns such as excessive use of special characters (e.g., ‘@’, ‘//’, or ‘-’), suspicious domain names, or long and complex URLs. These features can help in identifying malicious websites.

2. **Domain Features:**  
   Phishing domains often have a short lifespan, and many lack proper registration details (WHOIS data). Analyzing domain age and registrar information can be key indicators in phishing detection.

3. **Use of IP Addresses in URLs:**  
   Legitimate websites rarely use raw IP addresses in URLs, while phishing websites often do. Identifying this feature can improve detection accuracy.
