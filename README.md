## Phishing Domain Detection

# **Problem Statement**
#### Phishing is a type of fraud in which an attacker impersonates a reputable company or person in order to get sensitive information such as login credentials or account information via email or other communication channels. Phishing is popular among attackers because it is easier to persuade someone to click a malicious link that appears to be authentic than it is to break through a computer's protection measures.

#### Objective
#### The mail goal is to predict whether the domains are real or malicious.

#### **Key Project Details:**

1. **URL Structure Analysis:**  
   Phishing URLs often contain abnormal patterns such as excessive use of special characters (e.g., ‘@’, ‘//’, or ‘-’), suspicious domain names, or long and complex URLs. These features can help in identifying malicious websites.

2. **Domain Features:**  
   Phishing domains often have a short lifespan, and many lack proper registration details (WHOIS data). Analyzing domain age and registrar information can be key indicators in phishing detection.

3. **Use of IP Addresses in URLs:**  
   Legitimate websites rarely use raw IP addresses in URLs, while phishing websites often do. Identifying this feature can improve detection accuracy.

# **Project Summary**

#### ***Project Description:***
<h4>
Phishing stands for a fraudulent process, where an attacker tries to obtain sensitive information from the victim. Usually, these kinds of attacks are done via emails, text messages, or websites. Phishing websites, which are nowadays in a considerable rise, have the same look as legitimate sites. However, their backend is designed to collect sensitive information that is inputted by the victim. Discovering and detecting phishing websites has recently also gained the machine learning community’s attention, which has built the models and performed classifications of phishing websites. This paper presents two dataset variations that consist of 58,645 and 88,647 websites labeled as legitimate or phishing and allow the researchers to train their classification models, build phishing detection systems, and mining association rules.
